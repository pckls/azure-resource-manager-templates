Pushing up some of work I'm doing with Azure Resource Manager templates.

This deployment is based on an article that was published by Microsoft.
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/building-blocks/extending-templates/collector

## resource-group-creation

Following along with the [documentation online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/create-resource-group-in-template), but I also wanted to create tags during the deployment.
